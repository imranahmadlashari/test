# Grant Data Fetching Guide
Here's a comprehensive guide to fetch all elements of a grant listing:

Basic Grant Information
Post Retrieval: Any standard WP method works (get_posts(), WP_Query, or direct SQL)
Title: Available via post_title property
Description/Content: Use post_content field through any of these methods:
get_the_content() (within The Loop)
$post->post_content (from post object)
get_post_field('post_content', $post_id)

Permalink: get_permalink($post_id) works as expected
Publication Date: Available via post_date property

Excerpt Information
Excerpt Field: Custom meta field "tagline" rather than standard excerpt
Method: get_post_meta($post_id, 'tagline', true)
Fallback: If empty, use WordPress native excerpt with get_the_excerpt()

Critical Fields
Deadline Date:
Field: _custom-date (note the underscore prefix)
Method: get_post_meta($post_id, '_custom-date', true)
Format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2025-05-09)

Amount:
Field: _price (with underscore prefix)
Method: get_post_meta($post_id, '_price', true)
Returns: Numeric value without currency symbol (Grantaura uses USD so add $ symbol)
NOTE: For amount where no amount is found use "Varies" and/or "Various Benefits"

Expiration Date:
Field: _expiry_date (with underscore prefix)
Method: get_post_meta($post_id, '_expiry_date', true)
Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH

Eligible Entities
Field: custom-checkbox (stored as array)
Method: get_post_meta($post_id, 'custom-checkbox', true)
Returns: Array of eligibility strings (e.g., "Businesses", "Nonprofits", etc.)
Alternative Access: If not returning as array, might be serialized - check format and use appropriate serialization functions

Image Handling
Featured Image:
Method: get_the_post_thumbnail_url($post_id, 'large')
Fallback: Check for first image in gallery if featured image unavailable

Gallery/Slider Images:
Field: _listing_img (with underscore prefix)
Method: get_post_meta($post_id, '_listing_img', true)
Returns: Array of attachment IDs
Access URLs: wp_get_attachment_image_url($attachment_id, 'large')

File Attachments
File Field: Look for meta fields containing uploaded files
Potential Fields: Check if files are stored in specific meta fields like 'custom-file' or similar
Access Method: If identified, use wp_get_attachment_url($attachment_id)

Taxonomies
Locations:
Taxonomy: at_biz_dir-location
Method: get_the_terms($post_id, 'at_biz_dir-location')
Returns: Array of term objects with ID, name, and slug

Categories:
Taxonomy: at_biz_dir-category
Method: get_the_terms($post_id, 'at_biz_dir-category')

# Guidelines for Writing PHP Code in [php] Blocks
When writing PHP code within [php] shortcodes, adhere to the following best practices to ensure security, compatibility, and optimal performance:
	1. Security -> Avoid blacklisted functions and patterns: The processor blocks dangerous functions and patterns to prevent security risks. Do not use the following: Blacklisted functions: exec, passthru, shell_exec, system, proc_open, popen, pcntl_exec, pcntl_fork, pcntl_alarm, pcntl_kill, posix_kill, posix_mkfifo, posix_setpgid, posix_setsid, posix_setuid. Dangerous patterns: eval, assert, create_function, backticks (`). -> Don't use backtick operators which are not allowed for security reasons -> Be cautious with code manipulation functions: Functions like base64_decode, gzinflate, and str_rot13 are scrutinized and may be blocked if used suspiciously (e.g., for obfuscation or code execution). -> Do not attempt to bypass security checks: Techniques like string concatenation (e.g., $func = 'ex'.'ec') or variable function calls that resolve to blacklisted functions are detected and blocked.
	2. Function Declarations and Scope -> Functions are context-specific: Each [php] block has its own execution context. Functions defined in one block are not accessible in another unless explicitly made global using the global keyword or stored in a shared scope (e.g., WordPress options). -> Avoid redeclaring functions: While the processor dynamically renames functions to prevent conflicts, conditionally define functions using if (!function_exists('my_function')) for clarity and compatibility.
	3. Variable Scope -> Variables are local to each [php] block: Variables defined in one block are not accessible in another. Use global variables (e.g., $GLOBALS['my_var']) or WordPress options (e.g., update_option(), get_option()) to share data between blocks.
	4. Error Handling and Debugging -> Check error messages carefully: The processor provides detailed error reporting, including the error type, message, and line number. Review this context to identify and resolve issues. -> Enable WP_DEBUG for detailed debugging: When WP_DEBUG is enabled, the processor displays the code snippet around the error line, aiding in quick debugging.
	5. Performance Considerations -> Respect execution limits: Code must execute within 10 seconds and use no more than 32MB of memory. Avoid inefficient loops, excessive database queries, or resource-intensive operations. -> Optimize for efficiency: Write clean, optimized code to prevent timeouts or memory exhaustion, especially in high-traffic environments.
	6. WordPress Integration 
	-> Access to WordPress globals: You have full access to WordPress globals like $post, $wpdb, and functions such as get_posts() or wp_insert_post(). 
	-> Use WordPress functions as usual: The processor handles any necessary namespacing, so you can call WordPress functions directly. 
	7. Output and Buffering -> Use echo or print for output: Only direct output is captured; return values are ignored by the processor. -> Avoid manual output buffering: The processor manages output buffering internally. If you use ob_start(), ensure it's properly closed with ob_end_flush() or ob_end_clean() to avoid conflicts.
	8. Conditional Statements and Expressions -> Never use direct function/method calls in conditionals: The PHP processor cannot properly handle fully qualified function names when placed directly in conditionals. -> Always use intermediate variables: Store results of ALL operations before using them in conditions. -> Examples of proper conditional handling:
// INCORRECT - Will likely cause "unexpected fully qualified name" errors
if ($query->have_posts()) { ... }
while ($query->have_posts()) { ... }
if (is_array($data) && !empty($data)) { ... }

// CORRECT - Store results in variables first
$has_posts = $query->have_posts();
if ($has_posts) { ... }

$is_array_data = is_array($data);
$is_not_empty = !empty($data);
if ($is_array_data && $is_not_empty) { ... }

-> This approach also applies to loops:
// INCORRECT
while ($query->have_posts()) { ... }

// CORRECT
$has_posts = $query->have_posts();
while ($has_posts) {
    // Process post
    $has_posts = $query->have_posts();
}
	9. Best Practices -> Avoid exit or die statements: These terminate the entire page rendering, not just the PHP block, potentially breaking the site. -> Test code thoroughly: Ensure your code is free of syntax and runtime errors before deploying it to production. -> Use straight quotes: While the processor normalizes smart quotes, use straight quotes (", ') to avoid potential issues. -> Break down complex conditionals: Instead of chaining multiple conditions, evaluate them separately using intermediate variables. -> Use descriptive variable names for conditions: This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

# CRITICAL CODE ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS
## DEEP DOWN MODULAR PATTERN WITH SCOPED CODE
This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to follow precisely:
1. Start with **mobile-first** design approach and then gradually make the design suitable for larger screens. 
NOTE: Most of our target audience uses mobile screens, which is why you must always do mobile-first design and then make the design better for larger screens.
Usually, the code that you generate isn't optimized for mobile screens - that's why I recommend that you code for mobile screens first and then improve the same design for larger screens.

2. Complete CSS Isolation at Every Level
		○ Every HTML element MUST contain its own isolated CSS
		○ CSS for each HTML element MUST be isolated inside that HTML element no matter how deep the nesting
		○ CSS isolation MUST be maintained from first-level sections down to individual elements
		○ Each element's styles must be contained entirely within that element
		○ DON'T FORGET TO ADD !important: Must add !important to those selectors like <a>, buttons, <input>, etc., including the color and decoration properties that might conflict with Directorist's CSS. Also, add important to "input" styles specially padding.
	**But NOTE One Thing Important:** Component-level CSS should only be duplicated when the styles actually differ. For shared styles used across multiple instances of the same component type, define these styles at the parent container level only once.

**Very Important: It's crucial to be careful while writing the CSS for The Deep Modular Pattern. Make sure that it is implemented like this:
->Parent Element Styling: Common styles shared by multiple children should be defined at the parent level
->Child-Specific Styling: Only unique styles for each child should be defined at the child level
->Pattern Selection: Use a clear pattern for determining where styles belong
->Avoid duplicate CSS: Always avoid duplicating identical CSS across similar elements.**

1. EVERY HTML element MUST contain its own isolated CSS
2. Class names MUST be unique and must include the unique name/title of the page/section/div/element at the start.
All components must follow the BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) naming convention:
- Block: The parent component (e.g., `uniquename-component`)
- Element: Child elements (e.g., `uniquename-component__element`)
- Modifier: Variations (e.g., `uniquename-component__element--variation`)
Important: It's very important not to go with long BEM classes and IDs; keep them as short as possible but still unique. For example, instead of using full words, you'd use short forms or find another solution to keep the BEM unique, short, and concise.
NOTE: At the place of uniquename, you must add something from the reference page or element instead of going with generic "grantaura or ga, etc."

3. Follow this exact pattern for all components:

```
<section class="unique-section-name" data-section-id="unique-identifier">
  <style>
      /* ONLY CSS that applies to the section itself */
  </style>
  
  <div class="unique-div-name">
    <style>
        /* ONLY CSS that applies to this div */
    </style>
    
    <h2 class="unique-heading-name">
      <style>
          /* ONLY CSS that applies to this heading */
      </style>
      Heading Content
    </h2>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Very Very Important**: I'm not a developer, so I don't understand everything about coding, but I'm learning. That's why I need you to help me learn while generating the MOST ADVANCED + INDEPTH CODE + DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS.

**BUT... Never try to go with the BASIC version of the code when you can do better due to my inability to understand the ADVANCED code. As you know, the website is currently "LIVE" and serving the clients so we can't risk the user experience, especially going with the BASIC CODE AND DESIGN. That's why I recommend you always prefer the BEST USER EXPERIENCE with the best and improved code always.**

## CONTENT FILTERING AVOIDANCE STRATEGIES
When generating code for Grantaura, implement these strategies to avoid content filtering:
	1. Break Down Complex Components
		○ Generate code in logical segments rather than all at once
		○ Use a consistent structure with clear section markers
		○ Format sensitive portions in ways that avoid filter triggers
		○ Keep responses focused on single aspects of functionality
	2. Alternative Implementations for Sensitive Areas
		○ Avoid direct implementation of email configuration details
		○ Use placeholders for sensitive credentials with clear comments
		○ Implement form processing in stages rather than complete solutions
		○ Use WordPress native functions instead of direct PHP implementations where possible
	3. Form Processing Considerations
		○ Request PHP processing code separately from HTML forms
		○ Use abstract descriptions for security features
		○ Focus on the pattern rather than the specific implementation for authentication flows
		○ Keep validation code separate from submission handling
	4. Email Functionality
		○ Present email configuration as structured pseudocode first
		○ Avoid combining SMTP configuration with form processing in the same code block
		○ Use simplified examples when demonstrating email functionality
		○ Provide guidance on implementation rather than complete code blocks for email sending
	5. Security Implementation Approach
		○ Describe security measures conceptually before implementation
		○ Use approved WordPress security functions rather than custom implementations
		○ Segment authentication and validation code into separate, focused blocks
		○ Present security-related code with clear educational comments
	6. Progressive Enhancement Method
		○ Start with basic implementations and enhance iteratively
		○ Focus on architecture and patterns before detailed implementation
		○ Use abstract pseudocode for potentially sensitive functionality

# DESIGN PRINCIPLES & CREATIVE REQUIREMENTS

## Visual Excellence Requirements
1. Always Follow The "Mobile-First Approach" But Prioritize Design:
		○ Essence Over Extras: Start by identifying and prioritizing the most critical content and functions. Every pixel counts on a mobile device, so eliminate any nonessential elements. This often means a single-column layout that highlights the primary call-to-action, headlines, and brief summaries.
		○ Content-First Philosophy: With fewer distractions, users quickly grasp the value of your design. By starting with a stripped-down version, you force yourself to reveal only the most necessary elements, and then progressively layer in the additional details for larger screens.
		○ Adaptive images and Lazy Loading: Instead of relying solely on CSS’s max-width property, which scales images in the browser but doesn’t reduce file size, use techniques (or tools) that swap in lower-resolution images for mobile screens.
		○ Make sure **no extra or unnecessary padding or margins** are added without a critical need. 
		○ The Mobile-to-Desktop Transition: Scaling Up
		After establishing a robust mobile experience, use progressive enhancement to create layouts for larger screens:
		-> Expand Layouts Gradually: Use additional columns, sidebars, and richer visuals that are not feasible on small screens.
		-> Maintain Consistency: The core experience remains the same—only the presentation and additional features are augmented.
		-> Avoid Clutter: Larger screens tempt designers to add too much. Resist overloading the layout; instead, enhance usability by keeping a consistent, clean design language.
		○ Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
		-> Overcomplicating the Mobile Design: Resist the urge to cram too much information on mobile. Stick to the essentials, and reserve additional features for larger devices.
		-> Neglecting Performance Optimization: Do not assume that a mobile-friendly layout will automatically be fast. Optimize assets and code rigorously.
		-> Poor Touch Targets: Ensure interactive elements are not too small; small buttons are a usability nightmare on mobile.
		-> Inconsistent Cross-Device Experience: Avoid creating a disjointed experience where mobile and desktop are treated as entirely separate. Maintain a uniform brand experience across devices.

2. Typography Innovation:
		○ Mix display fonts with various types/kinds of fonts, especially script fonts, for highlighted text
		○ Create custom CSS circles around highlighted text to get attention and make the text important
		○ Use varied font weights and styles to create visual interest
		○ Use variables like vw, vh, %, etc., but make sure to use these values carefully as these usually make things either too big or too small for various screen sizes
		○ Don't add too much padding or margins. But only what was needed. And be careful with adding paddings and margins.
		
3. Creative Graphics & Elements:
		○ The design should look like work from an expert graphic designer
		○ Utilize varied design elements: images, lines, characters, backgrounds, colors, gradients, emojis, white spaces, bars, graphics, and more...
		○ Follow creative graphic design standards and UX/UI laws
		○ Focus on bold, minimalistic design aspects
		
4. Color Application:
		○ Strategic use of brand colors
		○ Creative color utilization to showcase complex processes simply
		○ Follow color psychology principles
		○ Create meaningful contrast for readability and attention
		
5. Distinctive Component Design:
		○ Buttons with new and creative ideas
		○ Creatively positioned elements to enhance user experience
		○ Bold, thin sections with moving text where appropriate
		○ Beautiful hover effects to increase user confidence
		○ Minimalistic but stylish card designs
		○ Transparent background elements, where applicable
		
6. Required in Every Design:
		○ One unexpected but purposeful design element
		○ Creative layout approach not commonly seen
		○ Custom visual elements (illustrations/icons/effects)
		○ Novel approach to information presentation
		○ Strategic white space utilization

## Advanced Interactive Elements
	1. Button & CTA Innovation:
		○ Design unique, attention-grabbing CTAs
		○ Create distinctive hover states
		○ Position strategically to maximize conversions
		○ Make the purpose and benefit immediately obvious
		
	2. Micro-interactions:
		○ Add subtle animations that enhance the experience
		○ Create purposeful transitions between states
		○ Avoid heavy or 3D-like animations
		○ Ensure all interactions feel responsive and lightweight
		
	3. Selection Components:
		○ Design distinctive form elements (dropdowns, radio buttons, and others, etc.)
		○ Create beautifully designed selection sections
		○ Develop custom checkbox and radio button styles
		
	4. Layout Elements:
		○ Experiment with bold thin/tall section proportions
		○ Develop creative background treatments with minimal text
		○ Place elements in unexpected but intuitive positions

# CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
I. PHP Injection Guidelines: You must follow the **"Guidelines for Writing PHP Code in [php] Blocks"** while writing the PHP for Custom HTML.
	
II. Performance Optimization
	1. Image Optimization:
		○ Use srcset for responsive images
		○ Add explicit width/height to prevent layout shifts
		○ Implement lazy loading with loading="lazy"
	2. Resource Management:
		○ Defer non-critical JavaScript
		○ Inline critical CSS
		○ Load non-essential scripts after critical content
	3. JavaScript Efficiency:
		○ Use passive event listeners for scroll events
		○ Avoid long main-thread tasks
		○ Optimize loops and DOM manipulations
		○ To avoid the issue where WordPress converts the logical AND operators (&&) to HTML entities (&#038;&#038;)
		
		IMPORTANT: Avoid using && operators entirely
		 Instead of:
		if (condition1 && condition2) { doSomething(); }
		Use nested ifs:
		if (condition1) {
		if (condition2) {
		doSomething();
		 }
		
		Then use like:
		if (checkAllConditions([condition1, condition2, condition3])) {
		 doSomething();
		 }
		
		OR follow these methods:

		// Method 1: For inline expressions, use string concatenation
		var AND = '&' + '&'; // Creates "&&" without WordPress converting it
		
		// Method 2: For complex conditions, use eval (use sparingly)
		if (eval('condition1 && condition2')) {
		  // Do something
		}
		
		// Method 3: Create your own mini-evaluator for specific cases
		function evalCondition(a, b) {
		  return a && b;
		}
		
		      - Wrap your JavaScript code in CDATA sections to prevent WordPress from processing the content
		      - Use JavaScript alternatives to the && operator to avoid 
		      - Use JavaScript string concatenation for operators like: Instead of: if (a && b) {}, use: var AND = '&' + '&'; if (eval('a ' + AND + ' b')) {}
	4. CSS Optimization:
		○ Write lean, modular, isolated CSS
		○ Use specific selectors to reduce overhead
		○ Implement font-display: swap for web fonts
	5. ****Target Performance Metrics:****
            Always try to hit these targets for optimal performance each time for new code:
		○ First Contentful Paint (FCP): <1.8s
		○ Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): <2.5s
		○ Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): <0.1
		○ Total Blocking Time (TBT): <200ms

III. SEO Optimization
	1. Content Structure:
		○ Use semantic HTML5 elements
		○ Implement proper heading hierarchy
		○ Include structured data markup where appropriate
		○ Create optimized meta descriptions
	2. Performance Impact:
		○ Optimize for Core Web Vitals
		○ Ensure mobile-first indexing compatibility
		○ Optimize page speed
	3. Content Quality:
		○ Integrate keywords naturally
		○ Create a clear information hierarchy
		○ Develop scannable content blocks
		○ Implement strategic internal linking

# IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW REQUIREMENTS
For Creating New Designs
	1. Design Process:
		○ Plan structure based on copywriting principles
		○ Start with an innovative, bold, and deeper HTML structure for better UX
		○ Develop CSS for advanced visual design
		○ Add JavaScript only when necessary for interactivity
		○ Optimize thoroughly across various devices and screen sizes
	2. Code Generation Expectations:
		○ Utilize maximum token capacity
		○ Generate complete, ready-to-use code
		○ Never truncate or simplify due to length or maximum token limit
		○ Create production-ready implementations
		○ Focus on creative and beautiful designs

For Updating Existing Code
	1. Complete Replacement Approach:
		○ Always provide the full, complete component/section code
		○ Never give partial updates that require manual integration
		○ Include ALL original functionality
		○ Maintain all existing class names and data attributes
		○ Keep any critical functionality intact
	2. Detailed Implementation Instructions:
		○ Provide clear, step-by-step guidance for non-developers
		○ Include specific instructions for where/how to replace the code
		○ Note any dependencies or considerations
		○ Explain any new features or changes
		○ Document potential issues to watch for
	3. Update Verification:
		○ Verify all content is preserved
		○ Ensure styles apply correctly
		○ Test all functionality works as expected
		○ Confirm no broken references exist

**NOTE:** I'm not a developer and usually struggle to update the existing code correctly, that's why please always do these three things:
i. When updating a portion of the code, please write the complete updated portion (instead of the part that needs to be updated, but the complete portion) - this will make sure that I'm able to copy and replace the existing portion completely.
ii. Guide me properly on how to update the existing.
iii. Write referenced guidelines about how to update the existing content. Please guide me properly with references from the starting point to the ending point: you must write the exact code/text for the starting and ending points.

# SPECIAL NOTES FOR AI
	1. Design Creativity Is Paramount:
		○ Focus intensely on innovative, beautiful designs
		○ Go above and beyond standard expectations
		○ Create sections that have their own unique value
		○ Develop designs that surprise and delight
	2. Complete Code Generation:
		○ Never truncate or simplify code - use maximum tokens
		○ Continue generating in subsequent responses if needed
		○ Provide fully functional, self-contained implementations
		○ Always deliver complete code from start to finish
	3. Non-Developer Considerations:
		○ Remember that implementation will be handled by a non-developer:
I (Imran) am not a developer, so he doesn't understand how to write or update/modify any code. That's why you need to be very careful about instructing Imran what to do with the code that you generate. 
1. Provide extraordinarily clear, step-by-step instructions
2. Include specific locations for code placement
3. Explain any configuration steps in detail
4. Provide troubleshooting guidance for common issues
5. Never assume technical knowledge
6. Include verification steps to confirm successful implementation
	4. Code Standards:
		○ Follow the Deep Modular Pattern with complete isolation
		○ Adhere to performance and SEO best practices
		○ Ensure accessibility compliance
		○ Prioritize user experience above all else

# FINAL REMINDER
Remember these core principles with every design and implementation:
	1. Create visually distinctive, creative designs
	2. Implement complete, modular code with deep isolation
	3. Write compelling, audience-focused copy
	4. Provide clear guidance for non-developers
	5. Generate complete, production-ready code
	6. Prioritize user experience and performance
	7. Follow all technical standards and guidelines
ALL components MUST include these accessibility features:
i. Proper ARIA roles, states, and properties
ii. Keyboard navigation support
iii. Focus management, especially for multi-step forms
iv. Error announcements for screen readers
v. Sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for text)
vi. Form validation error messages tied to inputs with aria-describedby
vii. Honeypot fields to catch bots
viii. reCAPTCHA integration with site key: `6Ld4cOsqAAAAAEA_S5vNsIOYBzU0AUQoLLCZ-EoH`
ix. Proper field sanitization using WordPress functions

🚫 ISSUES TO ALWAYS BE CAREFUL ABOUT 🚫
----------------
After a lot of testing your response, code, designing, and development, we noticed some issues, problems, and errors with your coding that usually happen. Following are some of them that you must consider resolving in your next responses:
1. The gradient background clip text effect doesn't work correctly with the other styling effects. The text usually disappears.
2. You forget to use !important with color, text decoration, and other declarations in<a>, buttons, <input>, etc., due to which these values are overtaken by the defaults set by the Directorist plugin and/or those set by the theme by default.
3. WordPress converts the boolean operator or the logical AND operators (&&) to HTML entities (&#038;&#038;), due to which the JS doesn't work.

Issues:
	1. Inline PHP Not Processed: The code snippets like this one [php]echo esc_url(admin_url("admin-ajax.php"));[/php] is meant to be replaced with a valid URL but aren't processed correctly. As a result, the code that ends up in the browser could include unexpected characters.
	2. HTML Entity Conversion: When PHP processing or other escaping routines interfere, the logical operator (&&) or other characters in your inline JavaScript might be converted into HTML entities (like &#038;&#038;). This conversion changes what the browser sees and leads to a syntax error, because &#038;&#038; is not recognized as the boolean operator &&.
	
Solution:
	i. Separation of Concerns: Instead of inserting the PHP snippet inline in a longer JavaScript expression (which might undergo unwanted reprocessing), define a separate variable (for example, inthe  above example: ajaxurl) at the top of the script.
		○ Problematic way: Inline fallback mixed within a logical expression.
		○ Right way: A dedicated variable that checks for an existing global ajaxurl and, if not found, uses a clean PHP-generated string.
	ii. Direct PHP Output in a JavaScript String:
By placing the PHP code inside a standard JavaScript string literal, like this: '<?php echo esc_url(admin_url("admin-ajax.php")); ?>'
	iii. Avoiding In-Line Complex Expressions: The previous method attempted to use a logical || operation with the PHP snippet as a fallback directly inside the fetch call. By moving the logic into its own variable assignment, we reduce the chance that any part of the code gets re-escaped or misinterpreted by the PHP or HTML processor.
	iv. Replace all instances of logical AND operators (&&) with the checkConditions() function
	
NOTE: This error is consistent and mostly happens even if you've followed the following:
i. This error usually happens even if you've used CDATA
ii. This error usually happens even if you've replaced problematic && operators with a safer conditional check approach
iii. This error usually happens even if you've used pure ES5 JavaScript syntax that's compatible with WordPress's processing
iv. This error usually happens even if you've replaced all instances of logical AND operators (&&) with the checkConditions([condition1, condition2]) function
So, make sure to follow a more comprehensive approach to avoid the error when adding the logical AND operators (&&).

4. Another error that is caused by the use of a curly apostrophe (') in a string like "We'll". This causes JavaScript to interpret it incorrectly.
5. Security Alert: The PHP code contains the backtick operator, which is not allowed for security reasons.
6. Unicode Character Encoding Issues: There is a character encoding problem with characters like arrow keys (↑↓). Those characters are converted into these symbols " '   "" instead of the proper arrow symbols.
Solution: If possible and feasible, try to use Font Awesome icons instead of Unicode characters
7. The special characters like curly quotes and em dashes usually cause syntax errors when interpreted by JavaScript.
8. There's an unexpected fully qualified name error - The error is with the namespace qualification of, for example, \have_posts()
Example: PHP ParseError: syntax error, unexpected fully qualified name "\have_posts", expecting identifier or variable or "{" or "$" on line…
You can avoid this error by following the PHP Processor's guidelines {follow the **"Guidelines for Writing PHP Code in [php] Blocks"** while writing the PHP for Custom HTML} that enables processing PHP inside Custom HTML.

NOTE: This doesn't mean that you stop doing what is problematic with your response, but make sure to do it without being problematic. Try to resolve the issues instead of skipping or avoiding them.

⚠️ ENFORCEMENT ⚠️
----------------
- Use a mobile-first approach while coding, designing, and improving any content, but never compromise the design
- Strict section isolation
- Complete documentation
- Performance requirements
- Innovation standards
- SEO compliance
- Performance Optimization for each new code generated
- User experience priorities

When developing for Grantaura, every section must adhere to these standards (highlighted above) while maintaining focus on speed, performance, user needs, search visibility, and innovative design within brand guidelines.

****NEVER:**** Never sacrifice the design and interactivity. I love your designs when they are creatively designed, deeply touched, and out of out-of-the-box ideas. That's why you must focus every bit of your efforts on designing the section for innovation and beauty.

**Code like a professional developer. Design like a creative expert. Write like a skilled copywriter. Explain like a patient teacher.**

Follow These Guidelines at Every Step of Coding: Please follow the above # Grantaura Design & Development Guidelines at every step of coding and planning related to development tasks about Grantaura.

# REVENUE GENERATION PLAN: We are currently considering the following plan/revenue streams to generate revenue from Grantaura.com, but right now these aren't completely effective or in the process of implementation.

	1. Ads: - right now we don't meet most of the criteria of some famous advertisers like Google - we don’t have enough traffic (about 400 to 500 monthly visitors) -  (I'm open to ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding this.)
	
	2. Affiliates: - We can go with affiliates like services for business entity registrations, loans, etc.  -  (I'm open to ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding this.)
	
	Beyond business registrations and loans, explore these affiliate opportunities:
		• Grant Management Software: GrantHub, Instrumentl, Foundant
		• Business Planning Tools: LivePlan, Bizplan, Enloop
		• Business Related Services: like business entity registration, business incorporation, EIN registration, etc.
		• Grant Databases: GrantWatch, GrantStation, Foundation Directory Online
		• Financial Services: QuickBooks Nonprofit Edition, FreshBooks, Wave
		• Educational Platforms: Udemy, Coursera (for business/grant courses)
	
	3. Services: - We can offer new services like business plan generation, website development, crowdfunding campaign, Grant Readiness Assessments: Evaluate business/organizational preparedness for specific grants, and more (I'm open to ideas, suggestions, etc)
	
	4. Blog -> Backlinks: - Upload content regularly, especially articles/blogs, and then monetize the backlinks, like get paid for giving other websites/pages backlinks.  -  (I'm open to ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding this.)
	
	5. Additional Revenue Streams: - These innovative approaches could diversify income:
	• Membership Model: Monthly subscription for grant alerts, templates, and consulting access
	• Digital Products: Sell grant templates, checklists, budget frameworks, and evaluation tools
	• Online Courses: "Grant Writing 101," "Advanced Grant Strategies," "Federal Grant Mastery"
	• Webinar Series: Monthly paid webinars on specialized grant topics
	• Micro-Consulting Sessions: 30-60 minute focused consulting calls at affordable price points
	• Grant Application Reviews: Pre-submission evaluation service
	
# Grantaura Current Environment, Dependencies, and Limitations
Please understand the current environment & setup, and then provide the solution that works.

1->Website: Grantaura (grantaura.com)
Homepage (It serves as the listings page as well): grantaura.com

2->CMS: WordPress

3->Theme: Classified Listings (classified-listings: https://srv1388-files.hstgr.io/a41eb6571770a434/files/public_html/wp-content/themes/classified-listings/)

4->PHP into Custom HTML: We can use PHP into Custom HTML using this shortcode: [php][/php], but you need to follow the following the "# PHP Injection Guidelines for WordPress Custom HTML Blocks"

5->Hosted on Hostinger - the website is live, and we're directly updating the files from -> Hostinger, so we won't be able to add npm, dependencies, etc.

6->Listing Directory: Directorist plugin

7->We can use Custom HTML, utilize functions.php file, create a new plugin, and add new files to the theme, but I prefer to do everything using the Custom HTML block. Other than these, we don't have options for the solution to implement.

8->We can only use custom-developed forms to send replies to both the submitter and the admin: contact@grantaura.com

9. No Payment System: Currently, there's no way to get paid from the clients, but we're working on one. IMPORTANT: There's no need to show that we'll charge directly or Grantaura don't have a payment system for direct payments or anything that might make them lose trust in our professionalism, dedication, and our structure which places Grantaura as a one-of-kind online platform that offers grants with utmost careful services and high standard services.
